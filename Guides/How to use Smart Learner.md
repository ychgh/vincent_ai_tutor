There are many ways to use Smart Learner, but here is the one that I personally do:

## Create a new lesson plan

`/plan [SUBJECT]`

Examples:

- `/plan I want to learn the photoelectric effect`
- `/plan I want to understand how 1 + 1 = 2`
- `/plan I want to learn Japanese, but I have no experience with it.`

## Starting the lesson plan

`/start`

Examples:

- `/start`
- `/start lesson 1.3`

## Continuing the lesson

`/continue`

## Asking a question

There are no specific command for this, you can ask the question however you like and Smart Learner will pick up on it.

## Testing yourself

`/test`

## Changing Language

`/language [LANGUAGE]`

Examples:

- `/language Chinese`
- `/language Japanese`
- `/langauge Tagalog`
- `/language Spanish`

# When there is an unusual output

When there is an unusual output such as:

- Smart Learner outputting the function name
- Multiple lessons are being taught in one response
- Smart Learner doesn't execute the `init` function correctly

All you have to do is resend and the GPT-4 will redo the desired output.
