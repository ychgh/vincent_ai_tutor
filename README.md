## Disclaimer
This project uses advanced AI models (GPT-5, GPT-4o, Claude, etc.) to generate content in different languages through the /language command. Please note that while these models are highly capable, translations may still vary in quality. Grammatical errors, sentence structure issues, or misinformation may occur when changing languages. Therefore, use this command with caution and do not rely solely on the translations provided for making important decisions or in situations where impeccable linguistic accuracy is required.
